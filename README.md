# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_using_R_Programming
The "Credit Card Fraud Detection using R" project is a machine learning project that aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various classification algorithms in R.

The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions made in Europe in September 2013, and it is highly imbalanced, with only 0.17% of transactions being fraudulent. The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or trends that may help detect fraudulent transactions. The EDA process involves visualizing the data using various graphs and charts, such as histograms and box plots, and examining the relationships between different variables in the dataset.
After EDA, the data is preprocessed and transformed to prepare it for modeling. The preprocessing steps include removing duplicates, scaling the data, and handling missing values.he transformed data is then split into training and testing datasets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.

Several classification algorithms are used in this project, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
